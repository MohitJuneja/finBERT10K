Item 7A.	Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
      Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt and investment portfolio. In our investment portfolio we do not use derivative financial instruments. We place our investments with high quality issuers and, by policy, limit the amount of risk by investing primarily in money market funds, United States Treasury obligations, high-quality corporate and municipal obligations and certificates of deposit.
      We may incur realized losses as a result of early redemptions of our debt securities. Our 51/2% convertible subordinated notes and 1% convertible senior notes are subject to changes in market value. Under certain conditions, the holders of our 1% convertible senior notes may require us to redeem the notes on or after December 15, 2010. As of December 31, 2004, the aggregate outstanding principal amount and the fair value of the 51/2% convertible subordinated notes were $56.6 million and $57.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2004, the aggregate outstanding principal amount and the fair value of the 1% convertible senior notes were $200.0 million and $222.0 million, respectively.
      We have operations in Europe and Asia. As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Additionally, we may continue to expand our operations globally and sell to customers in foreign locations, which may increase our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations.

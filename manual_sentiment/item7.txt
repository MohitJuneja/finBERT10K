Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The terms "we", "our", "ours" and "us" as used in this Form 10-K refer to Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. and its subsidiaries. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Overview

We are a publicly-traded real estate operating company focused principally on the ownership, operation, management, acquisition, expansion and selective redevelopment and development of high quality, strategically located properties containing a combination of office and laboratory space leased principally to tenants in the life science industry. We refer to these properties as "life science facilities".

In 2003, we:

Acquired four properties with an aggregate of approximately 267,000 rentable square feet.
Expanded our unsecured line of credit from $425 million to $440 million and extended its term to November 2006, which may be further extended at our sole option for an additional one-year period.
Obtained an unsecured term loan for $150 million that is due November 2008.
Sold three properties with an aggregate of approximately 289,000 rentable square feet.
Our primary source of revenue is rental income and tenant recoveries from leases at the properties we own. Of the 89 properties we owned as of December 31, 2003, four were acquired in 1994, nine in 1996, nine in 1997, 27 in 1998, six in 1999, 11 in 2000, five in 2001, four in 2002 and four in 2003. In addition, we completed the development of one property in 1999, five properties in 2000 (together with the 11 properties acquired in 2000, the "2000 Properties"), two properties in 2001 (together with the five properties acquired in 2001, the "2001 Properties") and two properties in 2002 (together with the four properties acquired in 2002, the "2002 Properties"). As a result of these acquisition and development activities, as well as our ongoing leasing and redevelopment activities, there have been significant increases in total revenues and expenses, including significant increases in total revenues and expenses for 2003 as compared to 2002, and for 2002 as compared to 2001.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). Our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We base these estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

REIT Compliance

We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under the Internal Revenue Code. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to our operations and financial results and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. We believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the Internal Revenue Code to enable us to qualify, and continue to qualify, as a REIT. However, it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a REIT, or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify.

If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, then we will be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. If we lose our REIT status, then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved and we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders.

Rental Properties and Properties Under Development

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141"), we perform the following procedures when making an allocation of the purchase price of real estate: 1) estimate the value of the real estate as of the acquisition date on an "as if vacant" basis, 2) allocate the "as if vacant" value among land, land improvements, buildings, building improvements, tenant improvements and equipment, 3) calculate the value of the intangibles as the difference between the "as if vacant" value and the purchase price, and 4) allocate the intangible value to above, below and at market leases, origination costs associated with in-place leases, tenant relationships and other intangible assets.

The values allocated to land improvements, buildings, building improvements, tenant improvements and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis using an estimated life of 20 years for land improvements, 40 years for buildings and building improvements, the respective lease term for tenant improvements and the estimated useful life of equipment. The values of above and below market leases are amortized over the life of the related lease and recorded as either an increase (for below market leases) or a decrease (for above market leases) to rental income. The values of at-market leases and origination costs are classified as leasing costs, included in other assets on our balance sheets and amortized over the remaining life of the lease. The values of other intangible assets are amortized over the estimated useful life.

Rental properties and properties under development are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than its carrying amount. Upon determination that an impairment has occurred, a write- down is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the property to its estimated fair value.

Capitalization of Costs

We capitalize direct construction and development costs, including predevelopment costs, interest, property taxes, insurance and indirect project costs, including payroll and other costs directly associated with the acquisition, development or construction of a project. Payroll costs not related to the construction, development or redevelopment of a project, or acquisition of a property that will be classified as operating at the date of acquisition, are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as incurred. Costs previously capitalized related to abandoned acquisition or development opportunities are written-off. Should development activity cease, a portion of interest, property taxes, insurance and certain costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization, and would be expensed as incurred.

We also capitalize costs directly related and essential to our leasing activities, including broker fees and certain costs related to our leasing personnel. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Costs previously capitalized related to unsuccessful leasing opportunities are written-off.

Accounting of Investments

We hold equity investments in certain publicly-traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life science industry. All of our investments in publicly-traded companies are considered "available for sale" under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" ("SFAS 115"), and are recorded at fair value. Fair value has been determined by the closing trading price at the balance sheet date, with unrealized gains and losses shown as a separate component of stockholders' equity. The classification of investments under SFAS 115 is determined at the time each investment is made, and such determination is reevaluated at each balance sheet date. The cost of investments sold is determined by the specific identification method, with realized gains and losses included in other income.

Investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under the cost method because we do not influence any operating or financial policies of the entities in which we invest. Certain investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, "The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock" ("APB 18") and Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Topic D-46, "Accounting for Limited Partnership Investments". Pursuant to APB 18, the equity method of accounting should be used when an investor has "the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of an investee even though the investor holds 50% or less of the voting stock". EITF- D-46 further clarifies the Securities and Exchange Commission's position on the accounting for limited partnerships and provides that the equity method of accounting be used unless the investor's interest "is so minor that the limited partner may have virtually no influence over partnership operating and financial policies". Under the equity method of accounting, we record our investment initially at cost and adjust the carrying amount of the investment to recognize our share of the earnings or losses of the investee subsequent to the date of our investment.

For all of our investments, if a decline in the fair value of an investment below its carrying value is determined to be other than temporary, such investment is written down to its estimated fair value with a non-cash charge to current earnings.

The factors that we consider in making these assessments include, but are not limited to, market prices, market conditions, prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results, new product initiatives and new collaborative agreements.

Interest Rate Swap Agreements

We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates associated with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan. These agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating interest payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount. Interest received under all of our swap agreements is based on the one- month LIBOR rate. The net difference between the interest paid and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense.

We reflect our interest rate swap agreements on the balance sheet at their estimated fair values. We use a variety of methods and assumptions based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date to determine the fair values of our interest rate swap agreements. These methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value may never be realized.

All of our interest rate swap agreements meet the criteria to be deemed "highly effective" under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 in reducing our exposure to variable interest rates. Accordingly, we have categorized these instruments as cash flow hedges. While we intend to continue to meet the conditions for such hedge accounting, if hedges did not qualify as "highly effective", the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings.

We do not believe we are exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk in our interest rate swap agreements as our counterparties are established, well-capitalized financial institutions.

Recognition of Rental Income

Rental income from leases with scheduled rent increases, free rent and other rent adjustments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms. We maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our tenants to make required payments. If a tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance, we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of unpaid rent and deferred rent.

Discontinued Operations

The determination of whether a property qualifies as an asset "held for sale" and should be classified as discontinued operations requires an evaluation of certain criteria, some of which require the use of judgment. A property is classified as "held for sale" when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been met: 1) management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the property, 2) the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition, subject only to the terms that are usual and customary, 3) an active program to locate a buyer, and other actions required to complete the plan to sell, have been initiated, 4) the sale of the property is probable and is expected to be completed within one year, 5) the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value, and 6) actions necessary to complete the plan of sale indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. When all of these criteria have been met, the property is classified as "held for sale" and its operations are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income. When a property is designated as "held for sale", amounts for all prior periods presented are reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations. A loss is recognized for any initial adjustment of the asset's carrying amount to fair value less costs to sell in the period the asset qualifies as "held for sale". Depreciation of assets is discontinued commencing on the date they are designated as "held for sale".

Results of Operations

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2003 to the Year Ended December 31, 2002

Rental revenue increased by $14.7 million, or 13%, to $126.4 million for 2003 compared to $111.7 million for 2002. The increase resulted primarily from the 2002 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2003 Properties. Rental revenue from properties operating for a full year during 2003 and 2002 (the "2003 Same Properties") increased by $1.7 million, or 2.1%, due to increases in rental rates and offset by a slight decrease in occupancy. The average occupancy level of the 2003 Same Properties was 96.7% as of December 31, 2003, compared to 97.2% as of December 31, 2002.

Tenant recoveries increased by $3.1 million, or 11%, to $32.1 million for 2003 compared to $29.0 million for 2002. The increase resulted primarily from the 2002 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2003 Properties. Tenant recoveries for the 2003 Same Properties increased by $659,000, or 2.9%, primarily due to increases in certain recoverable operating expenses.

Other income increased by $511,000, or 33%, to $2.1 million for 2003 compared to $1.6 million for 2002, primarily due to an increase in realized gains on investments and from a general increase in miscellaneous sources of income.

Rental operating expenses increased by $3.7 million, or 13%, to $32.8 million for 2003 compared to $29.1 million for 2002. The increase resulted primarily from the 2002 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2003 Properties. Operating expenses for the 2003 Same Properties increased by $871,000, or 4.1%, primarily due to an increase in property insurance and property taxes (substantially all of which are recoverable from our tenants through tenant recoveries).

General and administrative expenses increased by $775,000, or 6%, to $14.2 million for 2003 compared to $13.4 million for 2002, mainly due to general increases in administrative costs, primarily payroll and related expenses.

Interest expense increased by $1.4 million, or 6%, to $26.4 million for 2003 compared to $25.0 million for 2002. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in indebtedness on our unsecured line of credit, unsecured term loan and secured notes payable. These borrowings were utilized to finance the acquisition of the 2002 and 2003 Properties and the development and redevelopment of properties. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by a decrease in the floating interest rate on our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan. The weighted average effective interest rate on our borrowings (not including the effect of swap agreements) decreased from 3.07% as of December 31, 2002 to 2.64% as of December 31, 2003. We have entered into certain swap agreements to hedge a portion of exposure to variable interest rates with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Unsecured Line of Credit and Unsecured Term Loan").

Depreciation and amortization increased by $5.7 million, or 17%, to $38.6 million for 2003 compared to $32.9 million for 2002. The increase resulted primarily from depreciation associated with the 2002 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2003 Properties.

Income from discontinued operations of $11.1 million for 2003 reflects the results of operations of one property that was designated as "held for sale" as of December 31, 2003 and three properties that were sold during 2003. In the fourth quarter of 2003, we sold one property in the Suburban Washington D.C. market. In the third quarter of 2003, we sold one property in the Eastern Massachusetts market. In the first quarter of 2003, we sold one property in the San Francisco Bay market. In connection with these sales, we recorded a net gain of approximately $8.3 million during 2003.

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2002 to the Year Ended December 31, 2001

Rental revenue increased by $18.1 million, or 19%, to $111.7 million for 2002 compared to $93.6 million for 2001. The increase resulted primarily from the 2001 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2002 Properties. Rental revenue from properties operating for a full year during 2002 and 2001 (the "2002 Same Properties") increased by $2.7 million, or 3.7%, due to increases in rental rates and offset by a slight decrease in occupancy. The average occupancy level of the 2002 Same Properties was 97.6% as of December 31, 2002, compared to 98.2% as of December 31, 2001.

Tenant recoveries increased by $4.9 million, or 20%, to $29.0 million for 2002 compared to $24.1 million for 2001. The increase resulted primarily from the 2001 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2002 Properties. Tenant recoveries for the 2002 Same Properties increased by $915,000, or 4.6%, generally due to an increase in certain recoverable operating expenses.

Other income decreased by $1.6 million, or 50%, to $1.6 million for 2002 compared to $3.1 million for 2001, primarily due to a decrease in interest income resulting from a decline in interest rates, the repayment of a $6 million secured note receivable in 2002 and a decrease in realized gains on investments.

Rental operating expenses increased by $4.5 million, or 18%, to $29.1 million for 2002 compared to $24.7 million for 2001. The increase resulted primarily from the 2001 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2002 Properties. Operating expenses for the 2002 Same Properties increased by $1.2 million, or 6.4%, primarily due to an increase in property insurance and property taxes (substantially all of which are recoverable from our tenants through tenant recoveries).

General and administrative expenses increased by $1.7 million, or 15%, to $13.4 million for 2002 compared to $11.7 million for 2001 due to the continued increase in the scope of our operations. From January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2002, we expanded our scope of operations to include an additional 13 properties containing approximately 880,000 rentable square feet for a total of 89 properties located in nine states with approximately 5.7 million rentable square feet as of December 31, 2002. To assist in managing this increase in the size of the operating portfolio, we added personnel and offices in certain of the markets where we have properties.

Interest expense decreased by $2.7 million, or 10%, to $25.0 million for 2002 compared to $27.7 million for 2001. The decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in the floating interest rate on our unsecured line of credit. The weighted average interest rate on our borrowings (not including the effect of swap agreements) decreased from 3.92% as of December 31, 2001 to 3.07% as of December 31, 2002. We have entered into certain swap agreements to hedge a portion of our borrowings at variable interest rates (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Unsecured Line of Credit and Unsecured Term Loan"). The decrease in interest expense caused by this factor was partially offset by an increase in indebtedness incurred to acquire the 2001 and 2002 Properties and indebtedness incurred to finance the development and redevelopment of properties.

Depreciation and amortization increased by $3.6 million, or 12%, to $32.9 million for 2002 compared to $29.3 million for 2001. The increase resulted primarily from depreciation associated with the 2001 Properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the 2002 Properties.

During 2002, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $2.5 million associated with a decline in the value of certain investments below their carrying value determined to be other than temporary.

Loss on early extinguishment of debt of $1.0 million was incurred as the result of the early retirement of a $7.2 million secured loan in connection with a refinancing of an asset. This loss is related to prepayment penalties and the write-off of loan costs. In 2002, this loss was classified as an extraordinary item as previously required under SFAS 4, "Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt". In 2003, pursuant to SFAS 145, "Rescission of FASB Statement No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections", we reclassified the 2002 loss on early extinguishment of debt to continuing operations.

Income from discontinued operations decreased by $934,000, or 35%, to $1.8 million for 2002 compared to $2.7 million for 2001. Income from discontinued operations reflects the results of operations of four properties that have been designated as "held for sale". In connection with these prospective sales, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1,150,000 related to a property in the San Francisco Bay market which cannot be redeveloped pursuant to its original strategic objectives. This charge has been included in income from discontinued operations for 2002.

 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Flows

Net cash provided by operating activities for 2003 increased by $7.8 million to $74.8 million compared to $67.1 million for 2002. The increase resulted primarily from increases in cash flows from our portfolio of operating properties, partially offset by the net gain on sales of property.

Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $88.0 million to $139.8 million for 2003 compared to $227.8 million for 2002. This decrease was primarily due to proceeds from the sales of rental properties and a lower level of property acquisitions in 2003.

Net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $96.0 million to $66.2 million for 2003 compared to $162.2 million for 2002. Cash provided by financing activities decreased primarily due to the net proceeds from our common stock and preferred stock offerings in 2002, partially offset by net proceeds from our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan and from secured notes payable.

We have a loan related to a property we developed in the San Francisco Bay market, which has a maturity date of 2005 that may be extended for an additional year. If we extend the maturity date of this loan to 2006, the weighted average interest rates for 2005 and 2006 would be 7.29% and 5.57%, respectively.
Unsecured Line of Credit and Unsecured Term Loan

We have an unsecured line of credit that provides for borrowings of up to $440 million. Borrowings under our unsecured line of credit, as amended, bear interest at a floating rate based on our election of either a LIBOR-based rate or the higher of the bank's reference rate and the Federal Funds rate, plus 0.5%. For each LIBOR-based advance, we must elect a LIBOR period of one, two, three or six months.

Our unsecured line of credit contains financial covenants, including, among other things, maintenance of minimum net worth, a total liabilities to gross asset value ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio. In addition, the terms of the unsecured line of credit restrict, among other things, certain investments, indebtedness, distributions and mergers. The unsecured line of credit expires November 2006 and may be extended at our sole option for an additional one-year period. As of December 31, 2003, borrowings outstanding on the unsecured line of credit carried a weighted average interest rate of 2.65%.

In November 2003, we obtained a $150 million unsecured term loan which bears interest at a floating rate based on our election of either a LIBOR based rate or the higher of the bank's reference rate and the Federal Funds rate, plus 0.5%. For each LIBOR based advance, we must elect to fix for a period of one, two, three or six months. The unsecured term loan contains financial covenants substantially similar to those in our unsecured line of credit. The unsecured term loan expires in November 2008. As of December 31, 2003, the unsecured term loan carried a weighted average interest rate of 2.62%.

Aggregate borrowings under the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan may be limited to an amount based on the net operating income derived from a pool of unencumbered properties. Accordingly, as we acquire or complete the development or redevelopment of additional unencumbered properties, aggregate borrowings available under the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan will increase up to a maximum of $590 million. Under these provisions, as of December 31, 2003, aggregate borrowings under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan were limited to $479 million.

We utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates associated with our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan. These agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating interest payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount (the "notional amount"). Interest received under all of our swap agreements is based on the one-month LIBOR rate. The net difference between the interest paid and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense.

The following table summarizes our interest rate swap agreements (dollars in thousands):

We do not believe we are exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk in our interest rate swap agreements as our counterparties are established, well-capitalized financial institutions. In addition, we have entered into master derivative agreements with each counterparty. These master derivative agreements (all of which are on the standard International Swaps & Derivatives Association, Inc. form) define certain terms between us and each counterparty to address and minimize certain risks associated with our swap agreements, including a default by a counterparty.

As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, our interest rate swap agreements have been reported in the accompanying balance sheets at their fair value as other liabilities of approximately $6.3 million and $9.0 million, respectively. The offsetting adjustments were reflected as deferred losses in accumulated other comprehensive income of $6.3 million and $9.0 million, respectively. Balances in accumulated other comprehensive income are recognized in earnings as swap payments are made.

Other Resources and Liquidity Requirements

In January 2002, we completed a public offering of 2,300,000 shares of our 9.10% Series B cumulative redeemable preferred stock. The shares were issued at a price of $25.00 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $55.1 million, net of offering costs. In February 2002, we sold 418,970 shares of our common stock. The shares were issued at a price of $39.46 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $16.1 million, net of offering costs. In July 2002, we sold 2,000,000 shares of our common stock. The shares were issued at a price of $41.07 per share, resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately $81.4 million, net of offering costs.

We expect to continue meeting our short-term liquidity and capital requirements generally through our working capital and net cash provided by operating activities. We believe that the net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make distributions necessary to continue qualifying as a REIT. We also believe that net cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to fund our recurring non- revenue enhancing capital expenditures, tenant improvements and leasing commissions.

We expect to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements, such as property acquisitions, property development and redevelopment activities, scheduled debt maturities, expansions and other non-recurring capital improvements, through excess net cash provided by operating activities, long-term secured and unsecured borrowings, including borrowings under the unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan and the issuance of additional debt and/or equity securities.

Exposure to Environmental Liabilities

In connection with the acquisition of all of our properties, we have obtained Phase I environmental assessments to ascertain the existence of any environmental liabilities or other issues. The Phase I environmental assessments of our properties have not revealed any environmental liabilities that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole, nor are we aware of any material environmental liabilities that have occurred since the Phase I environmental assessments were completed. In addition, we carry a policy of pollution legal liability insurance covering exposure to certain environmental losses at all of our properties.

Major capital expenditures consist of roof replacements and HVAC systems which are typically identified and considered at the time a property is acquired. Major capital expenditures also include one-time costs related to the implementation of our national branding and signage program in 2001, 2002 and 2003.
Major capital expenditures for 2003 include $1,072,000 ($0.19 per square foot in portfolio) in one-time costs related to the implementation of our national branding and signage program.
Recurring capital expenditures for 2002 include $552,000 ($0.10 per square foot in portfolio) related to a fully leased property in San Diego, California that underwent substantial renovation in 2002.
Excludes space that has undergone redevelopment before retenanting.
Capital expenditures fluctuate in any given period due to the nature, extent and timing of improvements required and the extent to which they are recoverable from our tenants. Approximately 91% of our leases provide for the recapture of certain capital expenditures (such as HVAC systems maintenance and/or replacement, roof replacement and parking lot resurfacing). In addition, we maintain an active preventative maintenance program at each of our properties to minimize capital expenditures required.

Tenant improvements and leasing costs also fluctuate in any given year depending upon factors such as the timing and extent of vacancies, property age, location and characteristics, the type of lease (renewal tenant or retenanted space), the involvement of external leasing agents and overall competitive market conditions.

Inflation

As of December 31, 2003, approximately 88% of our leases (on a square footage basis) were triple net leases, requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes and insurance, common area and other operating expenses (including increases thereto). In addition, approximately 7% of our leases (on a square footage basis) require the tenants to pay a majority of operating expenses. Approximately 93% of our leases (on a square footage basis) contain effective annual rent escalations that are either fixed (generally ranging from 3% to 3.5%) or indexed based on the consumer price index or another index. Accordingly, we do not believe that our earnings or cash flow from real estate operations are subject to any significant risk of inflation. An increase in inflation, however, could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate borrowings, including our unsecured line of credit and unsecured term loan.

Funds from Operations

GAAP basis accounting for real estate assets utilizes historical cost accounting and assumes real estate values diminish over time. In an effort to overcome the miscorrelation between real estate values and historical cost accounting for real estate assets, the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") established the measurement tool of funds from operations ("FFO"). Since its introduction, FFO has become a widely used non-GAAP financial measure by REITs. We believe that FFO is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity REIT. We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in its April 2002 White Paper (the "White Paper") and related implementation guidance, which may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs, and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. In 2003, NAREIT issued guidance which modifies the calculation of FFO for both past and future periods. In accordance with NAREIT's revised guidance, we now include losses from early extinguishment of debt and real estate impairment charges in our calculation of FFO. As such, the reported amounts of FFO for the year ended December 31, 2002 have been modified from those previously reported. The White Paper defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance for REITs, it should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. (See "Cash Flows" for information regarding these measures of cash flow.) We believe that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to FFO.

The following table presents our FFO for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):
